# Prototyping Playbook
https://mattrothenberg.github.io/prototyping-playbook/

A collection of short tutorials (or “plays”) geared towards designers who are interested in using the browser for their design and prototyping needs.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install Jekyll dependencies

```
bundle install
```

## Local Development

Spin up the web server locally by running `jekyll serve`. You can access the website locally at http://localhost:4000/prototyping-playbook/

## Collaboration
Prototyping Playbook is meant to be open and collaborative. If you'd like to see a play added, feel free to open an Issue. Feel like writing a play yourself? Even better! Send a PR and I'll work with you on getting it ready for prime time.

## Support
